# iOS-Profile-Lib
## Description
This library allows you to create and verify iOS mobileconfig files right on your iOS device.  I could find no other iOS library for dealing with iOS mobileconfig files so I made this one.  It features type checking to prevent the creation of invalid mobileconfigs.

## Requirements
It will work with just the standard library for the most part.
To encrypt a profile Crypto and biplist is needed.
